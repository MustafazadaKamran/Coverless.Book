                <h2>Albert Camus and Absurdism <br></h2>
                <p>Albert Camus (1913-1960) was a French philosopher and widely known for his literary works in philosophical concepts. He was the second youngest to win a Nobel Prize in Literature. What is the meaning of existence? That’s a question that Albert Camus explored in his novels, plays, and essays. His answer was perhaps a little depressing, as he was influenced by Kierkegaard’s (1813-1855) pessimism. He thought that life had no meaning, that nothing exists that could ever be a source of meaning, and hence there is something deeply absurd about the human quest to find meaning. Appropriately, then, his philosophical view was called (existentialist) absurdism. <br>
                <b>‘Life is absurd.’-Albert Camus <br></b> 

                According to Camus, life has no meaning. There is a conflict going on in humans to seek value and meaning in life. The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the absurd, but rather, the absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously. What would be the point of living if you thought that life was absurd, that it could never have meaning? This is precisely the question that Camus asks in his famous work, The Myth of Sisyphus. He says, <br>
                <b>“There is only one really serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.” <br></b>

                He was haunted by this question of whether suicide could be the only rational response to the absurdity of life. The problem here is that everyone we know and love will die someday, and some of them will suffer tremendously before that happens. How is that anything but absurd? Camus, he thought that life was devoid of intrinsic meaning. But he thought we could give it a kind of meaning by embracing illusion. Here is the overview of absurdist: <br>

                <b>● The absurd is the futility of a search for meaning in an incomprehensible universe, devoid of God, or meaning. <br></b>
                <b>● Absurdism arises out of the tension between our desire for order, meaning, and happiness and, on the other hand, the indifferent natural universe’s refusal to provide that.<br></b>
                <b> ● Camus asserts that we should embrace the absurdity of human existence and take on the purpose of creating value and meaning.<br></b>
                <b>● For Camus, suicide is a “confession” that life is not worth living; it is a choice that implicitly declares that life is “too much.” Suicide offers the most basic “way out” of absurdity: the immediate termination of the self and its place in the universe. <br></b>
                But, Camus did not support suicide. In his The Myth of Sisyphus, he states that, <br>
                <b>“This, I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness, I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide.” <br></b>
                For Camus, life is full of absurdity. We have to live our life with consequences. If we try to find happiness, what is it? We will never be happy. If we try to find out the meaning, we will never live.
