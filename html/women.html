               <p><i>“Within every woman is a wild and natural<br>
                 creature, a powerful force, filled with good <br>
                instincts, passionate creativity, and ageless knowing. <br>
                 Her name is Wild Woman, but she is an endangered species.” – Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Estes</i></p><br>

                 <p><b>Summary:</b> Dr. Estes is a Jungian Psychoanalyst who believes that the true spirit of woman has been buried deep in the depths of her soul, to the point that she is somewhat unrecognizable even to herself. Women Who Run With the Wolves is a collection of stories aimed at uncovering the primal woman within. <br>
                    According to Dr. Estes, there is a connection between women and wolves; she believes they share a psychic bond in their fierceness, grace, and devotion to their families and mate. This comparison defines the Wild Woman Archetype throughout the book. <b>It shows the reader how fulfilling and glorious it is to be daring, to be nurturing, and to be a woman. <br></b>
                    I believe most women can relate to feeling as though their energy has been tamped down by the world… that we all have areas of our lives where we are playing it safe, staying small, and not shining as brightly as we could. What would happen if every woman felt empowered to trust herself? If we came together in community, allowed one another to be vulnerable, and shared stories with authenticity and love? What kind of world would emerge?<br>
                    <var>Why I Love It:</var> This book is full of inspirational stories that may help you tap into your psyche and open your intuition. I was reminded of life before modern technology made everyone accessible but also less connected. I love that this book reignited my desire for authentic connection, both with my own primal nature and with all of womanhood. <b>I believe the vulnerability and strength of women can change the world.</b>
                    


                    <b>Recommended For:</b> All my sisters out there, this book is for you! There is a primal wisdom held deep within us all just waiting to be birthed into our lives. These stories reveal characters who struggle to find this wisdom, before tapping into their innate potential and learning to live more freely from the heart.

                <h2>What I learned from this book?</h2><br>
                <p><b>1. Overcivilization is the Death of the Soul<br></b>
                    Maybe you were raised in the spirit of being a nice submissive girl, with sweet little braids, playing with Barbies, and never using bad words. And if you preferred to climb trees, you were labeled a “tomboy.” And if you wore ripped Nirvana tees you were “going through a phase.” Then came the adulthood and society tried to mold you into a little triangle on the bathroom door, squeeze you into a pencil skirt, perfectly-ironed shirt, and flawless smile. <br>
                    
                    Surely there’s nothing bad about being socialized but you must remember that there’s a Wild Woman inside of you and she wants to chortle out loud, run naked through the forest, and dance with the wolves. She wants to be free and brave, she wants to create with her bare hands, get dirty and sweaty while making a life of her own. She’s your strength when the world is trying to break your spirit. So dig out those old bones of your everlasting soul and let in passion and creative madness in your life. <br>


                    <b>2. Trust your Intuition, Not the Wicked Stepmother <br></b>
                    Intuition is the compass you come with to this world. We give it up so easily for the voice of our parents, teachers, bosses, partners, psychoanalysts… Meanwhile, all you need to know is already inside of you. The Wild Woman whispers answers to your ear and if you only trust her, she will lead you through life. Clarissa illustrates the process of sharpening your instincts in the analysis of an old Russian tale Vasalisa the Wise. <br>

                    Vasalisa, a young clueless girl separated from her inner knowing at an early age, goes through a terrifying process of initiation before she’s granted the light of understanding. That’s what we must do to regain our intuition — go into the unknown and face whatever’s hiding there. In moments of difficulty, we will hear clearer than ever the voice of inner wisdom. Going to the woods to fetch fire from the old hag might be something different for each of you — a solo journey, a creative project, a business of your own… Listen to your own knowing and let it lead you. <br>

                    <b>3. Don’t Trade Your Soul for Safety <br></b>
                    Making a life of your own is damn difficult. We often chose the safety of a stable job, socially-accepted lifestyle, and financially-securing marriage over making that wild dream of ours come true. We get seduced by gilded carriages and the promise of easy life like the peasant orphan in The Red Shoes by Hans Christian Andersen. Naive and easily impressed, the little girl exchanges her handmade red shoes for the comforts and security of having a rich patron. <br>

                    But the life of the soul is in its creations and once you get a taste of it all you want is your deep life to be back. You want to be free, go and do whatever you want, sew your shoes with your own hands, or dance to the moonlight like the seal woman in the Sealskin, Soulskin tale. Just like that wild creature, deprived of her skin/soul, you will become thinner and thinner, paler and paler, just a shell of a woman. You might look for some poor replacement of the dream lost, such as the new pair of red shoes, a new lover, or far too many shots of Tequila, just to make yourself feel alive again. But nothing, nothing, will replace your soul. So quit whatever is holding you back, be it a job, a man, or social circles, and finally start doing what your heart is craving for. <br>
                    <b>4. Find Your Pack and Embrace Who You REALLY Are <br></b>
                    Do you remember the story of the Ugly Duckling who was bullied and rejected due to its unfortunate appearance, just to grow up to become a gorgeous swan? The miserable hero of this heart-wrenching story was never ugly nor unable. It simply did not belong to its environment and that’s what happens to many women. They suffer from the Syndrome of Mistaken Zygote, delivered by accident to the wrong family, raised in the community that has never understood them and called them inappropriate/naughty/dumb/ugly <br> 

                    This world is full of uncombed cats and cross-eyed hens who will laugh at your dreams. A hen will never understand why you would want to swim and a cat — what the point of flying is. Conversely, domesticated Stepford wives will raise their condescending eyebrows when hearing about your plans of moving to Cambodia or becoming a professional base jumper. Or quite the opposite — your rebellious feminist colleagues will snort with disgust at the confession that your life goal is to be a perfect mother to five plump babies. But there’s nothing wrong with you in any of those cases. You’re simply surrounded by hens and ducks and you’re a goddamn swan. Just as Clarissa said, “Anyone who does not support your art, your life, is not worth your time.” Abandon relationships with those who are not on your side. Find your True Pack. <br>

                    <b>5. Death is a Part of Life <br></b>
                    Clarissa writes a lot about Life/Death/Life cycle according to which a Wild Woman lives. Everything dies but death is never the end of things but just the beginning. Our bodies are the perfect representation of this cycle of decease and renewal on a monthly basis. And just like our cells we too must resign from our old ways so new ideas, relationships and projects can come to replace them. <br>

                    We die to our little-girl selves to become women and we die to our adventurous times of exploration to become mothers. There’s beauty in every stage of life, there’s wisdom in being a crone, even though the world is trying to convince us that the old age and wrinkles are the biggest shame.Your brain is all wrinkled and it’s the most beautiful body part you have. <br>

                    Those were some of my learnings from WWRWW.And finally <br>
