                <p><b>About the author:</b> David Eagleman is an American writer and neuroscientist, teaching at Stafford University as an adjunct professor in the department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences. He independently serves as the director of the Center for Science and Law. He is known for his work on brain plasticity, time perception, and neurolaw. <br></p><br>
                <h2>The book review</h2><br>
                <p>We all know that our brain is important, but do we appreciate them as much as we ought to?<br>

                    While having coffee with a friend, do we really have to concentrate on the act of lifting the cup?<br>
                    
                    No. But how does our brain, trapped inside a cranium, know the exact height and angle to raise the cup to bring it to our lips? How does it calculate the exact alignment for balance while we are walking, and orient the body accordingly?<br>
                    
                    Why does time seem to slow down into the moments leading to life- threatening accidents?<br>
                    <b>The Brain</b> – A book by David Eagleman gives an insight into some functions of the human brain, making it thoroughly enjoyable in the process. He answers many questions like those posed above, and if that’s not enough, he has also supported his conclusions on solid experimental proofs and existing cases of deviations from the normal.

                    In order to keep it relatively simple, Eagleman merely skims the surface without going into any debatable depth. This also greatly limits the audience of the book, but to be fair a wide audience can hardly be expected for a topic so vast. People well versed with neurology will perhaps already know the facts stated in this book. <br>

                    Credit is deserved by Eagleman for conscious avoidance of too much medical jargon, keeping it simple and within layman comprehension bounds. Brownie points to him for including a detailed explanation of complex terms wherever required. One such is below: <br>
                    <b>Proprioception :</b> Even with your eyes closed, you know where your limbs are: is your left arm up or down? Are your legs straight or bent? Is your back straight or slumped? This capacity to know the state of your muscles is called proprioception…. <br>

                    …. You can experience your proprioception fail temporarily if you’ve ever attempted to walk after one of your legs has gone to sleep…. Without a sense of the position of your own limbs, simple acts like cutting food, typing or walking are almost impossible. <br>
                    The Brain is well compartmentalised into 6 parts, for our better understanding (also maybe since our brain is able to store information better when fed in organised parts). <br>

                   1. Who Am I? <br>

                   2. What is Reality?<br>

                   3. Who’s in control?<br>

                   4. How do I decide?<br>

                   5. Do I need you?<br>

                    6. Who will we be?<br>

                   Adding a lot of value to the book are stories of various people with abnormal brains, the parts I looked forward to the most. The ultimate chapter is almost fully conjecture. This is the part which explores future possibilities for the human brain – and depending on their beliefs, some will think of it as the crown jewel of the book, some as the weakest part of the book. <br><br>
                   The French philosopher <b>Rene Descartes</b> wondered how we could ever know if what we experience is the real reality. How do I know I’m not a brain in a vat? Maybe someone is stimulating that brain in just the right way to make me believe that I’m here and I’m touching the ground and seeing those people and hearing those sounds. <br>
                   The Brain showcases our brain in all its glory to us, so we can appreciate the amount of effort it puts in to make our life easier, the humongous network of neurons that functions so in sync we don’t even realise it, the amazing marvel of nature that we are! With every page we turn, we discover a new fact about how we function. <br>

So what does the world outside your head really “look” like? Not only is there no colour, there’s also no sound : the compression and expansion of air is picked up by the ears, and turned into electrical signals. The brain then presents these signals to us as mellifluous tones and swishes and clatters and jangles. Reality is also odourless: there’s no such thing as smell outside our brains. Molecules floating through the air bind to receptors in our nose and are interpreted as different smells by our brain. The real world is not full of rich sensory events; instead, our brains light up the world with their own sensuality.
