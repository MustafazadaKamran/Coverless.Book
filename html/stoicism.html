                <p>The Roman emperor — Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, was the last well-known philosopher of ancient times.
                    According to the tradition, Marcus was a Stoic. <br>

                    When the Antonine Plague hit Europe from AD166 to around AD180 (Duration:14 years), Marcus had no
                    choice but to follow a mindful lifestyle in hard times. That’s when he wrote private notes to
                    himself on ideas of Stoic philosophy. <br>

                    In short, Marcus Aurelius provided us with a framework for dealing with daily life stresses and
                    developing self-restraint. <br>

                    Although the concept of Stoicism is very ancient, its guiding principles are still applicable today
                    — according to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist Donald J. Robertson. <br>

                    The book “How to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius” is 293 pages
                    long. Every page examines Stoicism deeply and informs its readers using simple language. <br><br>

                    So below are 3 main key lessons extracted from the book “How to Think Like a Roman Emperor.” Let’s
                    get started. </p><br><br>

                <h2>1. Let Go of What You Cannot Control</h2><br>

                <p>Robertson believes that worrying about things we cannot control deprives us of inner peace & calm.
                    <br>

                    Marcus Aurelius spent his life mastering this mentality and eventually succeeded. Marcus, in the
                    end, realized he could not control anything beyond his means: life and death. <br>

                    All human lives are inevitable. No one has ever achieved to purchase life points with money. No one
                    is immortal. <br>

                    “From the moment we’re born we’re constantly dying, not only with each stage of life but also one
                    day at a time.” — Donald J. Robertson. <br>

                    Marcus believes that our bodies are no longer the same to which our mothers gave birth. This means
                    we are ‘constantly changing.’ One minute is when we get closer to death and away from our birth
                    span. <br>
                </p>

                <h2>How to apply?<br></h2>

                <p>Donald J. Robertson
                    advises applying cognitive dissonance — looking at your own feeling and reactions from a third
                    person’s point of view. <br>

                    For example, if you’re worried you’ll die one day and where your wealth will go, try thinking from a
                    3rd person’s perspective. <br>

                    Here, you sound: greedy, irrational, and even unnatural. Hence, to take charge of our emotions and
                    become the best version of ourselves, try noticing with the eyes of others. <br>

                    It’s not that hard <br>
                    Some things you can change <br>
                    Some things you can’t <br>
                    The good news is that you can always take charge of your emotions and look at problems as a natural
                    fact. This will lessen the impact of problems you cannot control. Easy.<br>
                <p><i>“You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.” —
                        Marcus Aurelius.</i></p> <br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>2. Make Friends With Nature</h2> <br>

                <p>Philosophers of the Stoic school believed in living a simple yet meaningful life. <br>

                    Marcus believes that we must all adapt to nature. It’s nature, from where we belong. We must live in
                    alignment with the natural world, always. Marcus Aurelius often said: <br>

                    “To live as nature requires.”

                    And

                    “All that is harmony for you, my Universe, is in harmony with me as well. Nothing that comes at the
                    right time for you is too early or too late for me.” <br>

                    Stoics believed in living a simple but meaningful life. A life where we concentrate on rational
                    thinking and logical reasoning. In fact, it’s what keeps us sane. <br></p>

                <h2>How to apply?</h2>
                <p>When we make peace with nature, we also strive for a higher purpose. <br>

                    Now, making peace with our nature is not limited. It also means accepting reality. <br>

                    We must make peace with the lives we have. Good or bad, it’s what we have right now. Dreams are
                    good, but they’re not logical or rational. We should accept: <br>

                    ● Our condition <br>
                    ● Life around us <br>
                    ● The way our lives are built <br>
                    ● Present <br>
                    Therefore, when we contemplate nature, we accept who we are. That’s the first step towards
                    acceptance of ourselves. <br>

                    This is also known as a pragmatic approach, according to
                    Donald J. Robertson. It’s an approach that helps you deal with things sensibly and realistically.
                    They make you practical. <br>

                    Besides, with the pragmatic approach, you can focus on present things, become close to your self and
                    maintain peace with everything that comes your way. <br><br></p>

                <h2>3. Brush Your Virtues With Practice</h2><br>
                <p>According to Stoicism, men have four core virtues to follow: <br>

                    ● Morality <br>
                    ● Courage <br>
                    ● Wisdom, and <br>
                    ● Moderation <br>
                    Donald J. Robertson believes that no man is perfect. Mastering these 4 virtues can take a lifetime of work. <br>

                    So how do we practice? Donald Robertson’s advice is to find a balance between these (4) virtues.
                    When you maintain a balance, you invite happiness and contentment to your lives. <br>

                    <i>“Practice even what seems impossible. The left hand is useless at almost everything for lack of
                        practice. But it guides the reins better than the right.” — Marcus Aurelius.</i> <br>

                    Stoics believe that the sooner you adapt to this virtue, the simpler your life becomes. In today’s
                    world, you can practice by: <br>

                    ● Morality- being nice <br>
                    ● Courage- taking a stand <br>
                    ● Wisdom- learning <br>
                    ● Moderation- not eating to the fullest<br>
                </p> 

                <h2>How to apply?<br></h2> 
                <p>By practicing these 4 virtues, you can find a healthy balance. Marcus Aurelius always believes that
                    results come from continuous actions. <br>

                    Every time you practice, you’re one step ahead of where you started. Victory. <br>

                    “Happiness is the reward one receives from virtuous living” — Stoic philosophy. <br>

                    A human bears a variety of challenges every day, including: negative feelings, anger, trauma, and
                    sadness. Stoic advice is to (observe) them objectively and completely (detach) these challenges from
                    yourself. <br>

                    Next, you can utilize the above 4 virtues to overcome problems in everyday life. <br>

                    Simple.</p> <br> <br>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Stoic lessons are not the final destination — It’s the start of something big. <br>

                    Each quiet saying opens a world to you. It takes time to master them. <br>

                    “Nothing great is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig. If you tell me that
                    you desire a fig, I answer that there must be time. Let it first blossom, then bear fruit, then
                    ripen.” Epictetus. <br>

                    Can you believe a person could think all his life philosophically, and we’re here, reading and
                    thinking it’s (enough for a day)? <br> <br>
                <h2>We’re better than this!
