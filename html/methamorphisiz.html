                <p>Haven’t we all wondered what our first thought would be if we woke up one morning and found ourselves
                    transformed to an unidentified, beetle-like insect? No? <br>

                    Anyway, that question is just one of the reasons you may want to read Kafka’s The Metamorphosis. The
                    novella from 1915 is still being debated and there are almost as many interpretations as there are
                    readers. Kafka himself never revealed the deeper meaning. Personally, I would like to think that –
                    similar to Murakami – there is no right or wrong; the interpretation is entirely up to the
                    individual reader. <br>

                    The amount of essays, reviews, articles and academic papers, which have been written about this
                    little story (60 pages on Kindle) is truly frightening. Also, The Metamorphosis has been analysed
                    through the lens of existentialism, religion, Freudianism and… As always with the classics, I wonder
                    how I can possibly add anything to the discussion. <br>

                    So instead of a traditional review, I’ll talk about lessons learned (spoilers included) <br><br></p>

                <h2>1. There are more important things in life than work – or are there?</h2><br>
                <p>Pre transformation, poor Gregor Samsa was a travelling salesman, a role he despised and only had
                    taken on to pay his parent’s debt. Being the conscientious sort, the first thing which occurs to
                    Gregor, when he lies in bed on his armour-like back with way too many legs kicking out in different
                    directions, is: he is going to miss his train and be late for work. <br>

                    It was so absurd and I wanted to tell him, there might be more important things to worry about than
                    work. And yet… As it turns out later, the lack of a job, the lack of a role to fulfil in the family
                    (and in society) is the beginning of the end for Gregor.</p> <br>

                <h2>2. If we no longer have a role to fulfil, we become an outcast.</h2><br>
                <p>When his father went bankrupt, Gregor took over as the sole breadwinner for his parents and little
                    sister. He therefore held a prominent role in the family. <br>

                    After the transformation, his family can’t even look at him, he is isolated to his room and has to
                    hide under the couch, when a family member occasionally enters. In the beginning his sister cleans
                    and provides food to Gregor and in a strange way he still is part of the family. But gradually, he
                    becomes more and more marginalised. His room isn’t cleaned anymore and is used to store random junk.
                </p> <br>

                <h2>3. When we no longer fulfil a role, others step up</h2><br>
                <p>Gregor’s parents are relatively miserable. His father lacks self confidence, has gained weight and
                    has become clumsy and slow. His mother suffers from serious asthma. But when Gregor can no longer
                    work, both of them step up and take a job. And Gregor’s father gains confidence and even his
                    appearance improves. The strain of their struggling economy still takes its toll, though.</p> <br>

                <h2>4. If nobody cares about us, is there anything left to live for?
                </h2> <br>

                <p>All the way through, Gregor’s sister has been the most supportive of him. But she goes through her own transformation during the story from child to a young woman. At first she takes on the task of looking after her brother, later she gets a proper job to support the family finances and finally she is the one who brutally, but also realistically, states it would be better for the family, if Gregor was gone. Gregor’s life had been going downhill for a while, with him being injured (his father threw apples at him) and stopping to move, stopping to eat, but this gives him the final push.</p> <br>

                <h2>5. Life is absurd – deal with it!
                </h2><br>
                <p>The underlying sadness in The Metamorphosis is counteracted by the absurd humour. Nobody questions the transformation. Gregor himself ponders on a strategy to get out of bed so he can get to work (a beetle has a different equilibrium than a human, hence turning around when one is lying on ones back is not as straightforward as one might wish). Gregor’s family is shocked and sad about loosing a family member. But nobody mentions, how strange and unlikely the transformation is. That is a lesson in itself: Life may throw a lot of weird shit upon you, best just to get on with it.</p> <br> <br>
